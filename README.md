## About This App 

This is a comprehensive MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) application that leverages the NOAA API to fetch weather data for a user-specified location. Users have the ability to register accounts, enabling them to save their preferred locations for convenient access in the future. This application is primarily designed for water sports enthusiasts, offering insights into local weather conditions to help them plan their activities effectively and maximize their time outdoors.

The user model supports full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing their saved locations.
